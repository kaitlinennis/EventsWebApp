This project is an Events Web Application that allows users to share and RSVP to Arts & Crafts events.\
Users are able to sign up for an account, log in, view all events, view each event's details, create\
their own event, edit the details of their created event, delete an existing event, RSVP to an event,\
and update their RSVP status. Users are also able to view their own profile, which lists the\
currently-logged-in user's created events, as well as events they have RSVPed to.\

Overall, I really enjoyed working on the project. It certaintly had its challenges, such as\
finding it difficult to implement the RSVP feature. But this project\
was so largely focused on learning about building the backend to an application\
and working with databases, and because it was something new for me, I found it very\
rewarding to overcome the issues I faced in this project and see that I was able to create\
a working application with a backend.\

To run this project, type the following 2 lines in your terminal:\
npm install\
